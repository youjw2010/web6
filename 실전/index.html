<p><strong>On the surface, f1 cars are very different from ordinary cars.</strong>
    <br>This is because they are made with very special designs and appearances <strong>to minimize air resistance and speed up</strong>.
    <br>They feature <strong>a sleek body</strong>, <><strong>la  rge rear wings</strong>, and <strong>detailed design considering airflow</strong>.</p>

<p>If you watched the video above, you will know.
    <br><strong>The f1 game is very different from other sports.</strong>
    <br>It is <strong>a race sport</strong> that <strong>competes primarily on a circuit (track)</strong> for a set distance or time.
    <br>After one race, <strong>points are earned according to the rank, and several races are added together to determine the season champion.</strong>
    <br>So how fast a race car can be produced is also a big challenge for engineers on each team.</p>
